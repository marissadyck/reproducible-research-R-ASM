### 1. Why do we need version control?

Does this seem familiar?

### 2. What is git? What is github? How are they related?

#### What is git?

Git is a *free*, *open source*, *distributed* version control software system. You install git on your computer and use it to track changes you make to files. Git does not make copies of each version of a file, which would take up space quickly, but rather keeps track of the changes you make to tracked files between *commits* (recording changes you have made).

#### What is github?

Github is a (mostly) free remote, cloud based repository for your work. You can use it to back up your work, share your work, recover older versions of your work, and much more.

#### How are git and github related?

Git tracks changes on your local computer, whereas github stores all of those changes to your files remotely.

You move your files and your changes between your local repository and your remote repository (hosted on github) via `push` and `pull` commands.

### 5. Let's try it - using git and github commands in the terminal

#### Basic git commands

You use git from the terminal on your computer. You can access the terminal right in RStudio, but you don't have to.
